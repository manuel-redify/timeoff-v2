# PRD 00: TimeOff Management Application v2 - Project Overview

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Senior Product Manager

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for rebuilding TimeOff Management Application as version 2, transitioning from a legacy Node.js/Express/Sequelize stack to a modern architecture using Next.js, shadcn/ui, Neon (PostgreSQL), Prisma ORM, Clerk, and deployed on Vercel (V0).

The TimeOff Management Application is an absence management system for small and medium-sized businesses that enables companies to track employee time-off requests, manage vacation allowances, handle approval workflows, and maintain organizational visibility into employee absences.
