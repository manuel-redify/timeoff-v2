## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the comprehensive requirements for company and organizational structure management in TimeOff Management Application v2. This includes company settings, department hierarchy, working schedules, public holidays, and organizational configuration that forms the foundation for absence management.

### Business Context

Organizational structure is critical for:

2. **Department Management**: Enable hierarchical organization with supervisor assignments
3. **Schedule Customization**: Allow company-wide and individual working schedules
4. **Holiday Management**: Track public holidays and company-specific days off
5. **Regional Adaptation**: Support multiple countries, timezones, and date formats
6. **Migration Path**: Enable smooth transition from v1's company structure

### Success Criteria

- All v1 company settings supported in v2
- Department hierarchy functions correctly with supervisor assignments
- Working schedules (company and individual) calculate allowances accurately
- Public holidays integrate with leave calculations
- Regional settings (timezone, date format) work across all features

## 8. Implementation Notes

### 8.1 Technical Considerations

**Performance:**
- Company settings cached in memory
- Department list cached with revalidation
- Schedule lookups optimized with indexes
- Holiday queries filtered by year

**Security:**
- All mutations require admin role
- RLS policies enforce company isolation
- API token stored securely
- Deletion requires confirmation

**Data Integrity:**
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- XOR constraint on Schedule table (company_id vs user_id)
- Cascading deletes handled carefully
- Transactions for multi-table operations

**Migration from v1:**
- Company settings mapped directly
- Departments preserve boss assignments
- Schedules converted from v1 format
- Holidays imported with country codes
- LDAP settings excluded (out of scope for v2.0)

### 8.2 Edge Cases

**Company Deletion:**
- Last admin cannot delete company if other users exist
- Must confirm by typing company name
- All data deleted permanently
- User logged out after deletion

**Department Deletion:**
- Cannot delete if users assigned
- Cannot delete last department
- Must move users first
- Supervisor assignments removed

**Schedule Changes:**
- Changing schedule with active users shows warning
- Historical calculations unaffected
- Future allowances recalculated
- At least one working day required

**Holiday Conflicts:**
- Duplicate dates allowed (different countries)
- Editing holiday with leaves shows warning
- Deleting holiday doesn't delete leaves
- Country matching handles null values

### 8.3 Future Enhancements

**Phase 2 Features (Out of Scope for v2.0):**
- LDAP integration for authentication
- Multi-language support
- Custom fields for departments
- Department hierarchy (parent/child)
- Half-day working schedules (morning/afternoon)
- Holiday templates for more countries
- Bulk holiday import from CSV
- Department-specific leave types
- Advanced reporting by department
- Department budgets and cost centers

---

## 9. Testing Requirements

### 9.1 Unit Tests

**Company Model:**
- Create company with defaults
- Update company settings
- Validate country codes
- Validate timezones
- Validate date formats
- Calculate carry-over
- Generate API token
- Delete company

**Department Model:**
- Create department
- Update department
- Assign boss
- Add/remove supervisors
- Validate allowance values
- Delete department
- Prevent deletion with users

**Schedule Model:**
- Create company schedule

- Validate XOR constraint
- Validate working days
- Update schedule
- Delete user schedule

**Bank Holiday Model:**
- Create holiday
- Update holiday
- Delete holiday
- Filter by year
- Filter by country
- Generate default holidays

### 9.2 Integration Tests

**Company Workflows:**
- Register new company → creates defaults
- Update company settings → changes reflected
- Delete company → all data removed
- Trigger carry-over → allowances updated

**Department Workflows:**
- Create department → boss assigned
- Add supervisors → permissions granted
- Remove supervisor → permissions revoked
- Delete department → requires empty department

**Schedule Workflows:**
- Edit company schedule → affects all users
- Create user schedule → overrides company
- Delete user schedule → reverts to company
- Validate working days → at least one required

**Holiday Workflows:**
- Create holiday → appears in calendar
- Import holidays → bulk creation
- Edit holiday → calendar updated
- Delete holiday → removed from calendar

### 9.3 End-to-End Tests

**Admin User Journey:**
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to company settings
3. Update company name and timezone
4. Create new department
5. Assign supervisors to department
6. Configure department allowance
7. Edit company schedule
8. Create user-specific schedule
9. Add public holidays
10. Import holidays for country
11. Verify all changes reflected

**Multi-Department Scenario:**
1. Create 3 departments
2. Assign different bosses
3. Add secondary supervisors
4. Set different allowances
5. Configure accrued allowance for one
6. Verify supervisor permissions
7. Verify allowance calculations

**Schedule Scenario:**
1. Set company schedule (Mon-Fri)
2. Create user with custom schedule (Mon-Wed)
3. Verify allowance calculations differ
4. Change company schedule
5. Verify user schedule unaffected
6. Delete user schedule
7. Verify user reverts to company schedule
