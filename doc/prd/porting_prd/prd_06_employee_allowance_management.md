# PRD 06: Employee Allowance Management

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 9, 2026  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Senior Product Manager

## Executive Summary

This document defines the requirements for Employee Allowance Management in TimeOff Management Application v2. The allowance system is the foundation for tracking how many days off employees are entitled to use, calculating pro-rated allowances for new hires, managing manual adjustments (days in lieu), implementing carry-over rules, and providing visibility into allowance consumption.

### Business Context

Accurate allowance management is critical for:
- **Compliance**: Ensuring employees receive their contractual entitlements
- **Transparency**: Employees can see their available days at any time
- **Planning**: Supervisors can make informed approval decisions
- **Reporting**: HR can track allowance usage across the organization

### Goals and Objectives

1. **Accurate Calculation**: Automatically calculate annual and pro-rated allowances
2. **Flexible Adjustments**: Support manual adjustments for special circumstances
3. **Carry-Over Support**: Implement configurable carry-over rules
4. **Real-Time Tracking**: Show current allowance status accounting for approved/pending requests
5. **Multi-Type Support**: Track allowances separately by leave type where applicable
6. **Audit Trail**: Maintain history of all allowance changes

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Allowance calculations match v1 logic exactly
- ✅ Pro-rating works correctly for mid-year hires and leavers
- ✅ Manual adjustments are tracked with audit trail
- ✅ Carry-over rules apply automatically at year boundaries
- ✅ Allowance displays are accurate and real-time
- ✅ Negative allowance handling works as configured

---

## 1. Allowance Calculation System

### 1.1 Base Allowance Sources

Allowances are determined by a hierarchy of sources:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Department Allowance** (if set on department)
2. **Company Default** (fallback if department has no allowance)

**Functional Requirements:**

**FR-6.1.1: Department-Level Allowance**
- Departments can define a base allowance (e.g., 25 days)
- This allowance applies to all employees in that department
- Stored in `departments.allowance` field
- Must be between 0 and 365 days
- Can be decimal (e.g., 25.5 days)

**FR-6.1.2: Company Default Allowance**
- If department allowance is 9999, system uses company default
- Company default is implicit (typically 20-25 days based on country)
- Configurable in company settings

**FR-6.1.3: Allowance Display**
- Show which source is being used (department vs company default)
- Display in employee profile and admin views
- Indicate if allowance is inherited from department

### 1.2 Pro-Rated Allowance Calculation

**FR-6.2.1: New Hire Pro-Rating**

When an employee starts mid-year, their allowance is pro-rated based on:
- `users.start_date`
- `companies.start_of_new_year` (month when allowance year begins)
- Base allowance from department or company

**Calculation Logic:**
```
remaining_months = months from start_date to end of allowance year
total_months = 12
pro_rated_allowance = base_allowance * (remaining_months / total_months)
```

**Example:**
- Base allowance: 24 days
- Allowance year: January 1 - December 31
- Start date: July 1, 2026
- Remaining months: 6 (July - December)
- Pro-rated allowance: 24 * (6/12) = 12 days

**FR-6.2.2: Mid-Year Leaver Pro-Rating**

When an employee has an `end_date` set:
- Calculate allowance only for months employed
- Formula: `base_allowance * (months_employed / 12)`
- Round to 2 decimal places

**FR-6.2.3: Partial Month Handling**
- If start date is after the 15th of the month, exclude that month
- If start date is on or before the 15th, include that month
- Same logic applies for end dates

**FR-6.2.4: Accrued Allowance Mode**

Departments can enable `is_accrued_allowance` flag:
- Allowance accrues monthly rather than granted upfront
- Each month, employee gains `base_allowance / 12` days
- Calculation: `months_completed * (base_allowance / 12)`
- Cannot use allowance not yet accrued

### 1.3 Leave Type Specific Allowances

**FR-6.3.1: Leave Types Using Allowance**

Leave types have `use_allowance` boolean:
- If `true`: deducts from employee's main allowance
- If `false`: does not deduct from allowance (e.g., sick leave, unpaid leave)

**FR-6.3.2: Leave Type Limits**

Leave types can have a `limit` field:
- Maximum days of this type that can be taken per year
- Independent of main allowance
- Example: "Work from home" limited to 10 days/year

**FR-6.3.3: Allowance Tracking by Type**
- Track total allowance consumed
- Track allowance consumed per leave type
- Display breakdown in employee view
- Support reporting by leave type

---

## 2. Manual Allowance Adjustments

### 2.1 Adjustment Types

**FR-6.4.1: Days in Lieu**
- Admins can add extra days for working weekends/holidays
- Positive adjustment increases allowance
- Recorded in `user_allowance_adjustments` table

**FR-6.4.2: Allowance Deductions**
- Negative adjustments reduce allowance
- Use cases: unpaid leave taken, disciplinary deductions
- Requires admin permission

**FR-6.4.3: Adjustment Tracking**

Each adjustment must record:
- `user_id`: Employee receiving adjustment
- `year`: Allowance year affected
- `adjustment`: Number of days (positive or negative)
- `created_at`: When adjustment was made
- Audit trail: Who made the adjustment (via audit_logs)

### 2.2 Adjustment Rules

**FR-6.5.1: Year-Specific Adjustments**
- Adjustments apply to specific allowance year
- One adjustment record per user per year
- Multiple adjustments in same year are cumulative

**FR-6.5.2: Adjustment Limits**
- No hard limit on adjustment amount
- System should warn if adjustment results in negative total allowance
- Admin can override warnings

**FR-6.5.3: Adjustment Permissions**
- Only admins can create/modify adjustments
- Employees can view their own adjustments
- Supervisors can view team member adjustments (read-only)

### 2.3 Adjustment Display

**FR-6.6.1: Allowance Breakdown Display**

Show employees:
```
Base Allowance:        25.0 days
Pro-rated Adjustment:  -6.25 days (started July 1)
Manual Adjustment:     +2.0 days (days in lieu)
Carry-Over:           +3.0 days (from 2025)
─────────────────────────────────
Total Allowance:       23.75 days

Used (Approved):       10.5 days
Pending Approval:      2.0 days
─────────────────────────────────
Available:            11.25 days
```

**FR-6.6.2: Adjustment History**
- Show all adjustments for current and past years
- Display date, amount, and reason (if provided)
- Link to admin who made adjustment

---

## 3. Carry-Over Rules

### 3.1 Carry-Over Configuration

**FR-6.7.1: Company-Wide Carry-Over Setting**

`companies.carry_over` field defines maximum days that can be carried over:
- `0`: No carry-over allowed
- `N`: Up to N days can be carried over
- `1000`: Unlimited carry-over (all unused days)

**FR-6.7.2: Carry-Over Calculation**

At the start of new allowance year:
```
unused_days = total_allowance - days_used
carry_over_days = MIN(unused_days, company.carry_over)
```

If `carry_over = 0`: No days carried over
If `carry_over = 5`: Maximum 5 days carried over
If `carry_over = 1000`: All unused days carried over

### 3.2 Carry-Over Application

**FR-6.8.1: Automatic Carry-Over**
- System automatically calculates carry-over at year boundary
- Stored in `user_allowance_adjustments.carried_over_allowance`
- Applied to new year's allowance

**FR-6.8.2: Carry-Over Expiration**
- Carried-over days typically expire at end of following year
- Configuration option: `carry_over_expiration_months`
- Default: 12 months (use by end of next year)

**FR-6.8.3: Carry-Over Usage Priority**
- Option 1: Use carried-over days first (FIFO)
- Option 2: Use current year days first
- Configurable per company

### 3.3 Carry-Over Edge Cases

**FR-6.9.1: Mid-Year Hire with Carry-Over**
- Employees starting mid-year cannot have carry-over
- Carry-over only applies to employees employed for full previous year

**FR-6.9.2: Leaver with Carry-Over**
- If employee leaves mid-year, carried-over days are lost
- No pro-rating of carried-over allowance

**FR-6.9.3: Department Change Impact**
- If employee changes departments with different allowances
- Carry-over is based on previous year's actual allowance
- New year uses new department's base allowance

---

## 4. Allowance Consumption Tracking

### 4.1 Real-Time Allowance Calculation

**FR-6.10.1: Current Allowance Formula**

```
total_allowance = base_allowance 
                + pro_rated_adjustment
                + manual_adjustment
                + carried_over_allowance

used_allowance = SUM(approved_leave_days WHERE use_allowance = true)

pending_allowance = SUM(pending_leave_days WHERE use_allowance = true)

available_allowance = total_allowance - used_allowance - pending_allowance
```

**FR-6.10.2: Leave Day Calculation**

For each leave request, calculate days based on:
- `date_start`, `date_end`
- `day_part_start`, `day_part_end` (all, morning, afternoon)
- User's working schedule (which days are working days)
- Company/department public holidays

**Half-Day Logic:**
- `all` = 1.0 day
- `morning` or `afternoon` = 0.5 day
- If start and end on same day with different parts = 0.5 day

**Multi-Day Logic:**
```
total_days = 0
for each date in range(date_start, date_end):
  if date is working day AND not public holiday:
    if date == date_start:
      total_days += day_part_start value
    else if date == date_end:
      total_days += day_part_end value
    else:
      total_days += 1.0
```

### 4.2 Allowance Status Indicators

**FR-6.11.1: Visual Indicators**

Display allowance status with color coding:
- **Green**: Available allowance > 5 days
- **Yellow**: Available allowance 1-5 days
- **Red**: Available allowance ≤ 0 days
- **Orange**: Pending requests exceed available allowance

**FR-6.11.2: Allowance Warnings**

Show warnings when:
- Available allowance is low (< 2 days)
- Pending requests would exceed allowance
- Attempting to request more than available
- Negative allowance (if permitted)

### 4.3 Negative Allowance Handling

**FR-6.12.1: Negative Allowance Permission**

Company setting: `allow_negative_allowance`
- If `true`: Employees can request leave beyond allowance
- If `false`: System blocks requests exceeding allowance

**FR-6.12.2: Negative Allowance Display**
- Show negative balance clearly (e.g., "-2.5 days")
- Highlight in red
- Show warning message to employee and supervisor

**FR-6.12.3: Negative Allowance Recovery**
- Negative balance carries over to next year
- Deducted from next year's allowance
- Example: -2 days in 2026 → 2027 allowance reduced by 2 days

## 7. Integration Points

### 7.1 Integration with Leave Request Workflow (PRD 04)

**When Leave Request is Submitted:**
1. Calculate days for the request
2. Check if allowance is available (if `use_allowance = true`)
3. If insufficient allowance and negative not allowed, reject submission
4. If sufficient or negative allowed, mark allowance as "pending"

**When Leave Request is Approved:**
1. Move days from "pending" to "used"
2. Update allowance consumption
3. Trigger allowance recalculation

**When Leave Request is Rejected:**
1. Release "pending" allowance back to available
2. Update allowance display

**When Leave Request is Cancelled:**
1. If approved: return days to available allowance
2. If pending: release pending allowance
3. Update allowance consumption

### 7.2 Integration with User Management (PRD 01)

**When User is Created:**
1. Calculate initial pro-rated allowance based on start date
2. Create `user_allowance_adjustments` record if needed
3. Display allowance in user profile

**When User Start Date is Modified:**
1. Recalculate pro-rated allowance
2. Update allowance adjustments
3. Notify admin of change

**When User End Date is Set:**
1. Recalculate allowance for partial year
2. Prevent new leave requests beyond end date
3. Handle carry-over (none for leavers)

### 7.3 Integration with Company Structure (PRD 02)

**When Department Allowance is Changed:**
1. Recalculate allowances for all users in department
2. Notify affected users of change
3. Update allowance displays

**When User Changes Department:**
1. Recalculate allowance based on new department
2. Preserve existing adjustments and carry-over
3. Log department change in audit trail

**When Public Holiday is Added/Removed:**
1. Recalculate leave request days that overlap with holiday
2. Update allowance consumption
3. Notify affected users

### 7.4 Integration with Reporting (PRD 09)

**Allowance Reports:**
- Allowance summary by department
- Allowance usage trends over time
- Employees with negative allowance
- Carry-over analysis
- Adjustment audit report

---

## 8. Migration from v1

### 8.1 Data Migration

**Migrate `user_allowance_adjustment` table:**
- Map `UserId` → `user_id` (resolve UUID)
- Copy `year`, `adjustment`, `carried_over_allowance`
- Preserve `createdAt` → `created_at`

**Migrate user allowance fields:**
- v1 stores `adjustment` and `adjustmentCarriedOver` in Users table
- v2 stores in separate `user_allowance_adjustments` table
- Create adjustment records for each user with non-zero values

**Migrate department allowances:**
- Copy `allowance` from Departments table
- Copy `is_accrued_allowance` flag
- Verify allowance values are within valid range (0-365)

### 8.2 Calculation Verification

**Post-Migration Validation:**
1. For sample of users, calculate allowance in v1 and v2
2. Compare results - must match exactly
3. Verify pro-rating calculations
4. Verify carry-over calculations
5. Verify allowance consumption matches

**Test Cases:**
- New hire mid-year (pro-rating)
- Employee with carry-over
- Employee with manual adjustments
- Employee with negative allowance
- Accrued allowance mode
- Multiple leave types with limits
