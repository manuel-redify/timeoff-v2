### Steps
- [ ] Step 1: Open `components/calendar/calendar-states.tsx`.
- [ ] Step 2: In the `EmptyState` component, increase vertical padding for mobile viewports (e.g., `py-16` -> `py-24` or similar).
- [ ] Step 3: Ensure the "Clear Filters" `Button` has a minimum height of `h-11` or `h-12` on mobile for better touch targets.
- [ ] Step 4: Verify that the `AlertCircle` and `Users` icons are sufficiently sized and centered.
- [ ] Step 5: Test the layout on a mobile screen with no results to ensure it feels balanced and actionable.

### Done When
- [ ] Empty state has adequate vertical spacing on mobile.
- [ ] Primary action button (Clear Filters/Try Again) is at least 44px high.
- [ ] UI is centered and legible on narrow viewports.
