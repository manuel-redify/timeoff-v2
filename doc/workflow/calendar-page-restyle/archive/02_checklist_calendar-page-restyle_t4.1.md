# Checklist - Task 4.1
**Parent:** `02_detailed_m4_calendar-page-restyle.md`

### Steps
- [x] Step 1: Design a `GridSkeleton` component in `WallChartView.tsx` that mimics the table layout.
- [x] Step 2: Implement pulse animation using Tailwind's `animate-pulse` and `bg-neutral-100`.
- [x] Step 3: Add skeleton blocks for the Employee names in the sticky column.
- [x] Step 4: Ensure grid lines (borders) remain visible during the skeleton state for structure.
- [x] Step 5: Implement smooth state switching to avoid layout shifts when data arrives.
- [x] Step 6: Verify headers and the action bar also have appropriate skeleton states.

### Done When
- [x] The calendar displays a structured pulse animation while loading.
- [x] The skeleton layout matches the final data layout (sticky columns/headers).
- [x] Transitions to loaded data are seamless and flicker-free.
