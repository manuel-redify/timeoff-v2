# Checklist - Task 1.3
**Parent:** `02_detailed_m1_calendar-page-restyle.md`

### Steps
- [ ] Step 1: Create a `FilterTag` sub-component in `calendar-header.tsx` (or a separate file if reused) using Redify styling.
- [ ] Step 2: Implement logic to track and display active filters based on the `filters` prop.
- [ ] Step 3: Add "X" button to each tag to remove specific filters.
- [ ] Step 4: Implement "Clear all" primary button next to tags when 2+ filters are active.
- [ ] Step 5: Ensure horizontal scrolling or wrapping if many tags are present.
- [ ] Step 6: Verify filter updates propagate correctly to the calendar view.

### Done When
- [ ] Active filters are visible as tags below the calendar header.
- [ ] Tags have Redify styling (1px border, Neutrals).
- [ ] Clicking "X" on a tag clears that specific filter.
- [ ] "Clear all" button clears all active filters at once.
- [ ] Layout is clean and respects the spacing of the new design.
