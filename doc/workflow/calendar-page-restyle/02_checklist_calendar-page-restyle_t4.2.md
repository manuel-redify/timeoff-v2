# Checklist - Task 4.2
**Parent:** `02_detailed_m4_calendar-page-restyle.md`

### Steps
- [ ] Step 1: Implement an `EmptyCalendarState` component with a Redify icon and "No records found" text.
- [ ] Step 2: Handle API errors in `WallChartView` and `CalendarHeader` with a "Failed to load" message.
- [ ] Step 3: Add a "Retry" button to the error state that triggers a fresh data fetch.
- [ ] Step 4: Apply Redify styling (centered layout, Neutral 400 text, 1px bordered container).
- [ ] Step 5: Test the empty state by applying filters that result in zero users.
- [ ] Step 6: Test the error state by simulating a network failure.

### Done When
- [ ] Users see a clear, styled message when no data is available.
- [ ] Errors are caught and presented with an actionable "Retry" option.
- [ ] Visual styling is consistent with the rest of the Redify application.
