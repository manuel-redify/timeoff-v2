# Checklist - Task 2.1

### Steps
- [ ] Step 1: Ensure the table container in `WallChartView` has `overflow-auto` and defined height constraints.
- [ ] Step 2: Apply `sticky top-0` and `z-10` to the `<thead>` element.
- [ ] Step 3: Apply `sticky left-0` and `z-20` to the "Employee" th/td column.
- [ ] Step 4: Implement the top-left "Employee" header cell as `sticky top-0 left-0` with `z-30` (intersection).
- [ ] Step 5: Update background colors for sticky elements to prevent transparency during scroll (Neutral 50/White).

### Done When
- [ ] Employee names remain visible when scrolling horizontally.
- [ ] Date headers remain visible when scrolling vertically.
- [ ] The top-left "Employee" labels remain fixed when scrolling in either direction.
