## STATE

Project Reference: Project Management Settings Module focused on project-user assignment capabilities. Core focus: manage projects, assign users, allocate resources, and filter/search within the scope of project management.

### Current Position
- Phase: 1 (Discovery/Definition) with planning for Phase 1 implementation.
- Plan: Prepare for Phase 1 delivery; confirm mappings and success criteria; align back to PROJECT.md requirements.
- Status: Draft roadmap aligned; awaiting feedback.

### Progress
- Phase progression: 0% complete (planning stage)
- Phase 1 milestones: approval and kickoff pending

### Accumulated Context (Decisions, Todos, Blockers)
- Decisions: Phases derived directly from v1 requirements; Phase 1 will cover Project CRUD and Status.
- To-dos: 1) Confirm requirement IDs for PRJ-01, PRJ-02; 2) Prepare UI mocks for Phase 1; 3) Align Prisma schema for Project entity.
- Blockers: Awaiting approval to proceed with Phase 1 implementation; potential dependency on client data model if project scopes include client association.

### Session Continuity
- Next step: Review ROADMAP.md, confirm acceptance, and begin Phase 1 implementation tasks.
