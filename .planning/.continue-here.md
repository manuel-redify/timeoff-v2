Spawning 4 parallel gsd-project-researcher agents for: Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls.

Actions taken:
- Created four research artifacts under .planning/research/ (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PITFALLS.md)
- Synthesized results into SUMMARY.md using gsd-research-synthesizer workflow.

Next steps:
- Orchestrator consumes SUMMARY.md and related artifacts to produce the Phase 6 plan.
- If any cross-cutting questions arise, request clarifications from stakeholders.
