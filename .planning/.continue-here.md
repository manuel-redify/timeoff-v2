<current_state>
Project initialization in progress, currently in the Research phase. Just finished setup and questioning, about to spawn 4 parallel research agents for:
- Stack research (project management UI components)
- Features research 
- Architecture research
- Pitfalls research

PROJECT.md and config.json have been created and committed. User wants to proceed with research before defining requirements.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- ✅ Git repo verified (existing)
- ✅ Brownfield detection completed (existing codebase + map found)
- ✅ Deep questioning completed
- ✅ PROJECT.md created and committed
- ✅ Workflow preferences configured (YOLO mode, Standard depth, Parallel execution)
- ✅ Research decision made (user chose "Research first")
- 🔄 About to spawn 4 research agents
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- 🔄 Spawn 4 parallel gsd-project-researcher agents
- ⏳ Synthesize research into SUMMARY.md
- ⏳ Define requirements based on research
- ⏳ Create roadmap with phases
- ⏳ Initialize STATE.md
- ⏳ Complete project initialization
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- User wants project management settings module for existing TimeOff system
- Foundation for approval workflows (coming next) and capacity planning (later)
- Allocation percentage capture now, usage later
- YOLO mode with Standard planning depth
- Research-first approach requested by user
- Model profile: Balanced (gpt-5-nano for planning, kimi-k2.5-free for execution)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- Task tool failed to spawn researchers - need to investigate
- Need to retry spawning the 4 research agents
</blockers>

<context>
User has a detailed PRD for project management settings module. This is a brownfield enhancement adding:
- Project CRUD operations
- User-project assignments with allocation percentages  
- Client management (optional)
- Project status management
- Role-based project access

The system is well-established with Next.js/TypeScript/Prisma stack. User specifically wants research before requirements to ensure best practices for the UI components and data models.
</context>

<next_action>
Retry spawning the 4 parallel gsd-project-researcher agents:
1. Stack research - project management UI components and libraries
2. Features research - standard features for this type of module
3. Architecture research - integration patterns with existing system
4. Pitfalls research - common issues and anti-patterns

Then synthesize with gsd-research-synthesizer into SUMMARY.md.
