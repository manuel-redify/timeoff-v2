## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Payroll integration | Out of scope for current phase |
| Mobile app | Web-focused approach initially |
| Multi-language support | English-only for v1 |
| Complex approval chains | Creates delays, unclear ownership |
| GPS/Location tracking | Privacy invasion, legal risks |
| Social features | Privacy concerns, unprofessional tone |
| Gamification | Creates unhealthy pressure around taking leave |
| Blockchain | Time off data doesn't need immutability |
| ML for decisions | Removes human judgment from sensitive decisions |
| Unlimited customization | Increases complexity, decreases maintainability |
| Real-time chat | Time off decisions aren't conversational |

## Traceability
